# Simple Superchat Application

# Technologies used:

HTML | CSS | TailwindCSS | NextJS | Firebase | React-Firebase-Hooks

# Things left to do:

1. Define css classes for 'sent' or 'received' - so that chatroom can know which UI to display
2. Make sure the chat messages stay within the chatroom window and have it scroll smoothly as more messages come in
3. Make it look better overall
4. Toggle Night mode
